# An implementation of the A* search algorithm. Although this can be used to
# search "perfect" mazes (those without loops), the recursive backtracker is
# more efficient in that case.
#
# The A* algorithm really shines, though, with multiply-connected mazes
# (those with non-zero braid values, or some symmetrical mazes). In this case,
# it is guaranteed to return the shortest path through the maze between the
# two points.
class Astar < Theseus::Solvers::Base

  # Although you will rarely need to use this class, it is documented because
  # applications that wish to visualize the A* algorithm can use the open set
  # of Node instances to draw paths through the maze as the algorithm runs.
